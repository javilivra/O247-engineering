# O247 – STRATEGIC CONTEXT

O247 is a structured travel planning platform starting with Orlando (Disney + Universal).

This repository contains both product logic and strategic documentation.

The `/docs` directory is the single source of truth for:

- Product decisions
- Brand positioning
- UX philosophy
- Technical constraints
- Future evolution

If code conflicts with documentation, documentation prevails.

Current Phase: Phase 1 – Structured Information Platform

Phase 1 is intentionally minimal.
No database.
No authentication.
No commerce.
No AI automation.

All architecture decisions must protect future scalability without implementing future complexity.
