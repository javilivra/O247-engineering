# CONTENT MODEL – PHASE 1

All content must follow structured blocks.

Page
→ Section
→ Strategy Block
→ Explanation
→ Practical Implication
→ Decision Guidance

No long unstructured paragraphs.
No emotional narrative dominance.
No influencer-style storytelling.

Content must be modular for future AI ingestion.
