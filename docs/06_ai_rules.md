# AI GENERATION RULES – O247

When generating code for this repository, AI systems must:

1. Respect all documents inside /docs as authoritative.
2. Avoid adding features not defined in the current phase.
3. Avoid introducing:
   - Sales funnels
   - Affiliate widgets
   - Emotional marketing elements
   - Overcomplicated UI patterns

4. Prioritize:
   - Readability
   - Scalability
   - Modularity
   - Future compatibility

5. If uncertainty exists:
   - Ask for clarification before generating code.

This repository is strategic-first, not feature-first.
