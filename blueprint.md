## Core Features & Design Philosophy

*   **AI-Powered Itinerary Generation:** The application leverages AI to create optimized daily plans based on user preferences, park data, wait times, and other variables.
*   **Modern & Clean UI/UX:** The design prioritizes clarity, ease of use, and aesthetic appeal. It uses a specific design system with a defined color palette and typography.
    *   **Colors:** `Bone` (#f7f7f5) for backgrounds, `Gunmetal` for text, and `Celeste` & `Sunset` for accents.
    *   **Typography:** `Google Sans Flex` for general UI and `JetBrains Mono` for data-specific elements (times, prices).
*   **Component-Based Architecture:** The application is built using a modular, component-based structure in Next.js, promoting reusability and maintainability.
*   **File-based Routing:** The project uses the Next.js App Router for clear and organized navigation.
